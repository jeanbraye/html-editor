# WPF Html Editor

This library provides an open, free, and purely WPF editor for HTML data. This library is based upon the code written and provided by Yannick Turbang at [C# WPF WYSIWYG HTML Editor](http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/870549/Csharp-WPF-WYSIWYG-HTML-Editor) on CodeProject.

### About this library

This library is being developed for two reasons: 1) to provide an HTML editor for the Shine calendar program 2) to create and maintain a capable, useful WPF-based HTML editor library for whoever may want it.

### Planned changes

- Remove "Gui", "Format", and "Initialisation" classes; put all functions into single, transportable user control
- Change color dialog to custom WPF color dialog
- Add basic support for tables (not immediate plan)

### License

The code, currently, is released under the [Code Project Open License](http://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx). I will be changing licenses later once enough changes are made to the code to be safely consiered a Derivative Work.
